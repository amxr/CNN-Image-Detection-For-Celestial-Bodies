              The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth
              largest satellite in the Solar System and the largest and most
              massive relative to its parent planet,[f] with a diameter about
              one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia).

            <p>
              The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky
              body, making it a satellite planet under the geophysical
              definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets of
              the Solar System.[17] It lacks any significant atmosphere,
              hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about
              one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being the
              only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface
              gravity and density.
